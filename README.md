# NOVA (NV) | TIDE – Token of Digital and Ethical Identity

**“Each human being has the right to own their own identity.” — ZAISS**

NOVA (NV) is a decentralized digital identity project focused on restoring sovereignty, security, and ethical transparency in the digital world.

TIDE stands for **Token of Digital and Ethical Identity** – a new category of crypto asset that does not compete, but completes. It does not divide, it connects. It does not impose, it flows.

### Core Principles
- **Transparency**
- **Integrity**
